    "# Graph Data Structure Implementation with BFS and DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This program implements a graph data structure and provides methods to perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph. The graph is represented using an adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Representation\n",
    "- **Adjacency List**: The graph is represented as a dictionary where the keys are the nodes, and the values are lists of adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "### `add_edge(self, u, v)`\n",
    "Adds an edge between node `u` and node `v` in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `bfs(self, start_node)`\n",
    "Performs Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the `start_node`.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: \n",
    "    - `start_node`: The node from which BFS traversal begins.\n",
    "- **Returns**: \n",
    "    - A list of nodes in the order they are visited during BFS traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `dfs(self, start_node)`\n",
    "Performs Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the `start_node`.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: \n",
    "    - `start_node`: The node from which DFS traversal begins.\n",
    "- **Returns**: \n",
    "    - A list of nodes in the order they are visited during DFS traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BFS (Breadth-First Search)\n",
    "- **Algorithm**:\n",
    "    1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the `start_node`.\n",
    "    2. Mark the `start_node` as visited.\n",
    "    3. While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "         - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n",
    "         - Visit all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited.\n",
    "         - Enqueue each unvisited adjacent node and mark it as visited.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: BFS is useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DFS (Depth-First Search)\n",
    "- **Algorithm**:\n",
    "    1. Initialize a stack and push the `start_node`.\n",
    "    2. Mark the `start_node` as visited.\n",
    "    3. While the stack is not empty:\n",
    "         - Pop a node from the stack.\n",
    "         - Visit all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited.\n",
    "         - Push each unvisited adjacent node onto the stack and mark it as visited.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: DFS is useful for exploring all possible paths in a graph and for topological sorting.\n",
